I am highly self-motivated junior software developer possessing a diligent and methodical approach to problem-solving, a tenacious desire to learn, and a love for building things. My career to date includes 12 years spent within the technical disciplines of project controls engineering in the oil & gas, defence, and infrastructure sectors and visual effects design as a 3D artist within the film and broadcast industries. I am also a champion of learning, with Bachelors Degrees in both Engineering and Visual Effects Design as well as, most recently, successful completion of the software development programme at Makers Academy in preparation for a new career within technical software development. Beginning this next stage of my career, I believe that my preexisting skills, tenacity, and drive will be invaluable to delivering tangible results in my new role. I hope to join a company that will nurture, guide, and enable me to grow and develop further, and I look forward to building real solutions to real problems, learning new technologies, and expanding my current knowledge.

## Skills

#### Problem-solving
As a project engineering consultant with the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) submarine operating centre, I was tasked with solving overrunning costs and project activity timescales. I approached the problem by identifying the underlying causes (lack of technical resource and expertise to construct detailed engineering schedules) and implementing solutions to address the challenges (defining scopes of work, developing fully-resourced and detailed engineering scheduled, improving communication, and training the engineering teams to take over these activities).

During the Acebook project at Makers (a Facebook-styled clone app), our group experienced challenges implementing encypted password storage to the database. To solve the problem, I researched, identified, and implemented an excryption method (BCrypt) capable of working with our project framework (Ruby on Rails). To ensure members of the group did not run into this challenge in future, I also shared this knowledge with the team and demonstrated how it worked.

#### Communication and Team Work
Successfully completing the final two-week group project at Makers required a committment to team work, communication, and building ways to work together within a high-pressure scenario in order to achieve a common goal. We collaborated via open discussions and critical thinking to determine the project focus and MVP features and utilised paired programming for front and back end development in order to support each other in learning and building within a new tech stack (MERN). We also cultivated patience, respect, and trust between group members, which was critical to the ability to rely on each other to complete different areas of the project. By using all of these skills, we succeeded collectively and implemented our overall objective of designing an application to teach young children coding concepts through fun stories and quizzes.

While acting as project controls liaison between Highways England and the construction engineering corsortium responsible for over 50 simultaneous live construction projects, continuous communication and teamwork were essential for successfully interacting across varying seniority levels, departments, and organisations. By fostering and developing relationships with key members of Highways England and the construction consortium, I was able to successfully carry out schedule assurance on behalf of Highways England, enabling projects to be kept on schedule and agree approaches to mitigate delays to project completion dates.

#### Self-motivation and Self-Learning
In order to complete a Bachelors of Engineering (Hons) degree through the Open University, I maintained a 6-year long dedication to self-directed learning, studying 20-30 hours per week in addition to full-time employment. This required sustaining a highly self-motivated drive and determination to complete all required learning, assignments, projects, and exams each year and resulted in achieving a 2:1 grade.

Attending the Makers programming bootcamp relied on my ability to self-motivate throughout an intensive 16-week programme of leaning new concepts, techniques, and technologies at a breakneck pace. I sustained 60 hours per week of individual and group learning by focusing on resiliency and a growth mindeset to overcome any blockers to learning, and I sought active feedback from coaches on written code and ways to improve. This dedication to self-learning has enabled me to achieve a strong foundational knowledge of essential programming concepts and equiped me to deal with complex programming challenges.

## Interests and Hobbies
* Building computers - I enjoy building my own desktop computers, researching hardware, and keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies
* Board games - My collection of board games includes far too many to count, and I love the social interaction with friends and family that comes from playing a game together
* Video games - As a keen PC gamer for several decades, I thoroughly enjoy well-crafted role-playing (Witcher, Elder Scrolls), strategy (Stellaris), and action games (Tomb Raider, Dark Souls), although finding time can be difficult!
