A highly self-motivated junior software developer possessing a diligent and methodical approach and a love for building things. My career to date has spanned both the highly complex technical area of project controls engineering within the oil & gas, defence, and infrastructure sectors and the fast-paced, creative, and technical area of visual effects design as a 3D artist within the film and broadcast industries. With this next stage of my career, I am excited to bring my technical, creative, and real-world business expertise together with my natural problem-solving ability in order to deliver tangible solutions in my new tech career.

As a champion of self learning, having completed a Bachelors of Engineering remotely over six years whilst in full time employment, I aim to bring this tenacity and drive with me to my next role, traits that I believe are invaluable as a developer.

I am exceptionally keen and motivated to start a new role as a junior developer with a company that will nurture, guide, and enable me to grow and develop further. I look forward to building real solutions to real problems, learning new technologies, and expanding my current knowledge.

## Skills

#### Problem solving
As a project engineering consultant with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) submarine operating centre, I was tasked with solving the challenge of overrunning costs and project activity timescales. To tackle the problem, it was important to first assess the underlying issues which were identified as a lack of technical resource and expertise to construct detailed engineering schedules. This was addressed by continual communication with the engineering teams, resiliency with driving positive change, due to an initiall lack of willingness to change from the then, current ways of working, and attention to detail in defining their scopes of work. From this we were able to develop fully resourced detailed engineering schedules that allowed the client to see the implications of activity slippage and for senior management to utilise this visability to make strategically informed decisions that would reduce project delays and rising costs.

My ability to problem solve was also valuable at Makers. During the Acebook project, a facebook styled clone app, our group were having issues with encrypting user login passwords and storing them in the database. I took the proactive approach of spending additional time in researching documentation and working with Ruby's BCrypt gem in order to understand how to get BCrypt to work with Ruby on Rails, our framework for the project. I successfully worked out how to store encrypted passwords to the database which was consequently incorporated into the project. Additionally, I shared my new knowledge and demonstrated to the team how it worked.

#### Communication and Team work
Working as a liason between Highways England and a construction engineering corsortium to carry out schedule assurance on the monthly formal submission of progression on over 30 simultaneous live construction projects. This required continuous communication and working as a team with varying seniority levels, departments and several different organisations to confirm realistic engineering project progress, raise issues to Highways England and to mitigate risks to project delivery dates. By fostering and developing relationships with key members of Highways England and the construction consortium and through working as a team, I was able to successfully carry out schedule assure on the behalf of Highways England. This enabled projects to be kept on schedule, or, for Highways England to agree approaches to mitigate delays to project completion dates.

The final project at Makers required me to employ exemplary team work and communication, utilising numerous related skills over the final two weeks. Learning a completely new tech stack (MERN) meant that I had to be committed to the team, in learning new tech quickly, and to the projects overall objective in order to succeed collectively. It also meant being patient and respectful as learning new tech required time and understanding on everyones part. Throughout the project it was necessarry to have collaborative reaseoned open discussion and decision making to be able to decide upon a final project idea, critically think about which features we could feasibily do in two weeks and which features needed to be left out of the MVP. Working in the team meant working collaboratively with everyone via pair programming on various aspects of both front and back end development and with being comfortable on relying on others to complete parts of the website, and being relied upon to complete my assigned tickets. By using all of these skills, we were able to implement our overall objective of designing an application that teaches young children coding concepts through fun stories and quizzes.

#### Self motivated
As a profoundly self-motivated individual, having completed a part time long distance Bachelors of Engineering (Hons) degree through the Open University over 6 years, working evenings and weekends whilst in full time employment, required an exorbitant amount of drive and determination in order to complete all required learning, assignments, projects, and exams each year. This challenge would not of been surmountable without these innate skills, which resulted in achieving a 2:1 grade.

At Makers, self motivation is essential. I took the initiative early on and continually strived to learn new concepts, techniques and technologies, often by taking time before and after Makers normal hours. Having set weekly goals in order to plan what to learn each week also led to having a sense of accomplishment, a key factor for staying motivated. Being resilient and having a growth mindset was fundamental in order to get past blockers and to continue to learn, whilst also seeking feedback from coaches on written code and ways to improve which I adopted as I continued. This has enabled me to have a good foundational knowledge on essential programming concepts and has better equiped me to deal with solving programming challenges.
