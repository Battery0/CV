A highly self-motivated junior software developer possessing a diligent and methodical approach and a love for building things. My career to date has spanned both the highly complex technical area of project controls engineering within the oil & gas, defence, and infrastructure sectors and the fast-paced, creative, and technical area of visual effects design as a 3D artist within the film and broadcast industries. With this next stage of my career, I am excited to bring my technical, creative, and real-world business expertise together with my natural problem-solving ability in order to deliver tangible solutions in my new tech career.

As a champion of self learning, having completed a Bachelors of Engineering remotely over six years whilst in full time employment, I aim to bring this tenacity and drive with me to my next role, traits that I believe are invaluable as a developer.

I am exceptionally keen and motivated to start a new role as a junior developer with a company that will nurture, guide, and enable me to grow and develop further. I look forward to building real solutions to real problems, learning new technologies, and expanding my current knowledge.

## Skills

#### Problem-solving
As a project engineering consultant with the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) submarine operating centre, I was tasked with solving overrunning costs and project activity timescales. I approached the problem by identifying the underlying causes (lack of technical resource and expertise to construct detailed engineering schedules) and implementing solutions to address the challenges (defining scopes of work, developing fully-resourced and detailed engineering scheduled, improving communication, and training the engineering teams to take over these activities).

During the Acebook project at Makers (a Facebook-styled clone app), our group experienced challenges implementing encypted password storage to the database. To solve the problem, I researched, identified, and implemented an excryption method (BCrypt) capable of working with our project framework (Ruby on Rails). To ensure members of the group did not run into this challenge in future, I also shared this knowledge with the team and demonstrated how it worked.

#### Communication and Team Work
Successfully completing the final two-week group project at Makers required a committment to team work, communication, and building ways to work together within a high-pressure scenario in order to achieve a common goal. We collaborated via open discussions and critical thinking to determine the project focus and MVP features and utilised paired programming for front and back end development in order to support each other in learning and building within a new tech stack (MERN). We also cultivated patience, respect, and trust between group members, which was critical to the ability to rely on each other to complete different areas of the project. By using all of these skills, we succeeded collectively and implemented our overall objective of designing an application to teach young children coding concepts through fun stories and quizzes.

While acting as project controls liaison between Highways England and the construction engineering corsortium responsible for over 50 simultaneous live construction projects, continuous communication and teamwork were essential for successfully interacting across varying seniority levels, departments, and organisations. By fostering and developing relationships with key members of Highways England and the construction consortium, I was able to successfully carry out schedule assurance on behalf of Highways England, enabling projects to be kept on schedule and agree approaches to mitigate delays to project completion dates.

#### Self-motivation and Self-Learning
In order to complete a Bachelors of Engineering (Hons) degree through the Open University, I maintained a 6-year long dedication to self-directed learning, studying 20-30 hours per week in addition to full-time employment. This required sustaining a highly self-motivated drive and determination to complete all required learning, assignments, projects, and exams each year and resulted in achieving a 2:1 grade.

The Makers intensive programming bootcamp relies on , I  strived to learn new concepts, techniques and technologies, often by taking time before and after Makers normal hours. Having set weekly goals in order to plan what to learn each week also led to having a sense of accomplishment, a key factor for staying motivated. Being resilient and having a growth mindset was fundamental in order to get past blockers and to continue to learn, whilst also seeking feedback from coaches on written code and ways to improve which I adopted as I continued. This has enabled me to have a good foundational knowledge on essential programming concepts and has better equiped me to deal with solving programming challenges.

## Interests and Hobbies
* Building computers - I enjoy building my own desktop computers, researching hardware, and keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies
* Board games - My collection of board games includes far too many to count, and I love the social interaction with friends and family that comes from playing a game together
* Video games - As a keen PC gamer for several decades, I thoroughly enjoy well-crafted role-playing (Witcher, Elder Scrolls), strategy (Stellaris), and action games (Tomb Raider, Dark Souls), although finding time can be difficult!
