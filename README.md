A highly self-motivated junior software developer possessing a diligent and methodical approach and a love for building things. My career to date has spanned both the highly complex technical area of project controls engineering within the oil & gas, defence, and infrastructure sectors and the fast-paced, creative, and technical area of visual effects design as a 3D artist within the film and broadcast industries. With this next stage of my career, I am excited to bring my technical, creative, and real-world business expertise together with my natural problem-solving ability in order to deliver tangible solutions in my new tech career.

As a champion of self learning, having completed a Bachelors of Engineering remotely over six years whilst in full time employment, I aim to bring this tenacity and drive with me to my next role, traits that I believe are invaluable as a developer.

I am exceptionally keen and motivated to start a new role as a junior developer with a company that will nurture, guide, and enable me to grow and develop further. I look forward to building real solutions to real problems, learning new technologies, and expanding my current knowledge.

## Skills
<!--
Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)
-How was the skill used?
-What did you do? (action)
-What was the result?


Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)
- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
-->





#### Problem solving
<!-- eg: OU degree(engineering is constant problem solving) Makers(constantly coming across unkown tech/ ways of doing things to get desired result) -->

As a project engineering consultant with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) submarine operating centre, I was tasked with solving the challenge of overrunning costs and project timelines. To tackle the problem, it was important to first assess the underlying issues causing the problem, which I identified as a lack of detailed engineering project plans caused by lack of resource and technical plannig expertise within the engineering teams. I addressed this by talking to the teams, defining a scope of work for each team, and from that, developing resourced engineering schedules that allowed the client to see the implications of task slippage and utilise this vivibility to make informed decisions and reduce project delays and rising costs.

Another paragraph for something Makers related?

#### Communication (working in teams, mentor, Pair Programming)
<!-- eg: Work(always working in teams to deliver to client(s)) Makers(final project presentation*link from YT*) -->


#### Team work
<!-- eg: Work(MoD, first proper role as consultant. Acted as part of a small specialised team) Makers(final project, acebook) -->


#### Self motivated
<!-- eg: OU degree, Taking on Makers(Self Learner) -->

<!-- As a profoundly self-motivated individual, having achieved the completion of a Bachelors of Engineering (Hons) degree through the Open University long distance over 6 years working weekends and evenings only whilst in full time employment. This required an exorbitant amount sheer determination and tenacity on my part in order to complete the required learning, assignments, projects, and exams each year. This challenge would not of been surmountable if I wasn't self motivated person. The result of my ability to propel myself forward through those 6 years of working full time and doing a degree in my spare time, led me to achieve a 2:1. -->
